# Etch-A-Sketch

The Etch-A-Sketch is a webpage based coloring game that allows the user to color in pixels, typically in black and white. This version begins in black and white, but will allow the user to change the colors as they see fit.

Overall, the users have the options to:

Change color
Random color
Black and white gradient color
Eraser button
Clear button
Adjust board size button

The rainbow button will give a random color by randomizing the RGB values seperately.

The gradient button will increase the opacity of a white pixel by 10%, and 10 passovers will result in a black pixel.

The eraser button will allow you white out whatever pixels the mouse passes over, effectively erasing the pixel.

The clear button will go through tile by tile and removing the colors from each.

The adjust size button will prompt the user for a number n, and the board will resize itself to (n * n) size.
